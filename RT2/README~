To compile:
	make
To run:
	./main <input-file>
Comments:
	Implemented soft shadows and spot lights.
	Might have large run-time for large bundle-size in computing soft shadows.
	Can change bundle size at line 102 in main.cpp.
	Currently at 60.
	Strobe angles in input file in degrees.
Example:
	./main face.txt
	This will create an output image called face.ppm.
