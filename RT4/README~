To compile:
	make

To run:
	./main <input-file>

Comments:
	Builds on previous ray-tracer.	
	Depth of field is also implemented.
	So artifacts in the output image are probably because of improper offsets.
	Can change the depth_of_field bundle size at line 372 of main.cpp.
	DEFAULT_R_D		The recursive depth for reflections
	DEFAULT_T_D 	The recursive depth for refractions
	These are found at the top of main.cpp.

Scenes:
	All scene files are located in the 'scenes' folder.
	My code requires that the texture files and the input-scene files are in the same folder.
	However it does allow the executable to be in a different folder from the scenes.
	I have 6 scene files corresponding to the requirements in the grading sheet.
	The interesting image can be generated from 'solar_eclipse.txt'.

	./main scenes/myscene.txt
		I'm using a resolution of 1024x1024, bundle size of 25 for depth-of-field, and recursive depths of 5 for reflections and refractions. Takes a pretty long time to run. To shorten run-time, decrease resolution to say, 256x256. This can be done by setting the resolution on line 5 in file scenes/myscene.txt
