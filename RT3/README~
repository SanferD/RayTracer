To compile:
	make
To run:
	./main <input-file>
Comments:
	Could not get results for parallel projection.
	I've implemented it by using the points on the view window as the ray origin and the view direction as the direction of the ray.
	Could be that the rays are too far apart
Scenes:
	All scene files are located in the 'scenes' folder.
	My code requires that the texture files and the input-scene files are in the same folder.
	However it does allow the executable to be in a different folder from the scenes.
	I have 6 scene files corresponding to the requirements in the grading sheet.
	The interesting image can be generated from 'solar_eclipse.txt'.
