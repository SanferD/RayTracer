To compile:
	make
To run:
	./main <input-file>
Comments:
	Builds on previous ray tracer.
	Implements texture mapping and polygons.
Scenes:
	All scene files are located in the 'scenes' folder.
	My code requires that the texture files and the input-scene files are in the same folder.
	However it does allow the executable to be in a different folder from the scenes.
	I have 6 scene files corresponding to the requirements in the grading sheet.
	The interesting image can be generated from 'solar_eclipse.txt'.
Example:
	./main scenes/solor_eclipse.txt
